AsciiWorld
==========

AsciiWorld is a reimplementation of GridWorld with an Ascii (and Unicode) based output rather than a Java GUI based one.

It was completed as en exercise to get me refreshed with the Java langauge, and is far from being full-featured, documented, and bug-free. A much better implementation could be made by just forking the original GridWorld code.
